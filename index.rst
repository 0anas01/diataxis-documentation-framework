Diátaxis Framework
========================================================

..  rubric:: A systematic framework for technical documentation authoring.

The Diátaxis framework aims to solve the problem of structure in technical documentation. It adopts a systematic
approach to understanding the needs of documentation users in their cycle of interaction with a product.

=============

..  sidebar:: *Diátaxis*

    From the Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς - *dia*, "across", and *taxis*, "arrangement".

The framework identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials**, **how-to guides**, **technical reference** and
**explanation**.

Each of these modes (or types) answers to a different user need, fulfils a different purpose and requires a different
approach to its creation.

In other words, what we call *documentation* is fundamentally not one thing, but four. Understanding the implications
of this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.


Diátaxis promises to make documentation and projects better, and the teams that work with them more successful.

====================


Light-weight and easily adopted
-----------------------------------

The framework is light-weight, easy to understand and straightforward to apply. It doesn't impose implementation
constraints.

Complete and comprehensive
----------------------------

Diátaxis provides a comprehensive and nearly universally-applicable scheme, that has been :ref:`proven in practice
across a wide variety of fields and applications <adoption>`. These include large and small, and open and proprietary
documentation projects.
