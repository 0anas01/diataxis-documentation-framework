    The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation

    -- David Laing

The Diátaxis framework aims to solve the problem of structure in technical documentation. It adopts a systematic
approach to understanding the needs of documentation users in their cycle of interaction with a product.

..  sidebar::

    The name *Diátaxis* comes from the Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς: *dia* ("across") and *taxis*
    ("arrangement").

Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials**, **how-to guides**, **technical reference** and
**explanation**. It derives its structure from the relationship between them.

In Diátaxis, each of these modes (or types) answers to a different user need, fulfils a different purpose and requires
a different approach to its creation.

Technical documentation should be structured explicitly around these four types, and should keep them all separate and
distinct from each other.

In other words, what we call *documentation* is fundamentally not one thing, but four. Understanding the implications
of this, and how those four different things work, can help improve most documentation.

    While redesigning the `Cloudflare developer docs <https://developers.cloudflare.com>`_, this content framework
    became our north star for information architecture. When we weren’t sure where a new piece of content should fit
    in, we’d consult the framework. Our documentation is now clearer than it’s ever been, both for readers and
    contributors.

    -- Adam Schwartz (`@AdamSchwartz <https://github.com/adamschwartz>`_)

Diátaxis promises to make documentation and projects better, and the teams that work with them more successful. It is
light-weight, easy to understand and straightforward to apply. It doesn't impose implementation constraints.

Diátaxis is :ref:`proven in practice <adoption>` across a wide variety of fields and applications, in large
and small, open and proprietary documentation projects.
