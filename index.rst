..  rubric:: A systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.

----------

Diátaxis is a way of thinking about and doing documentation. 

It prescribes approaches to content, architecture and form that emerge from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.

..  sidebar::

    *Diátaxis*, from the Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς: *dia* ("across") and *taxis* ("arrangement").

Diátaxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - *tutorials*, *how-to guides*, *technical reference* and *explanation*. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs.

Diátaxis solves problems related to documentation *content* (what to write), *style* (how to write it) and *architecture* (how to organise it). 

As well as serving the users of documentation, Diátaxis has value for documentation creators and maintainers. It is light-weight, easy to grasp and straightforward to apply. It doesn't impose implementation constraints. It brings an active principle of quality to documentation that helps maintainers think effectively about their own work.

Diátaxis is proven in practice. Its principles have been adopted successfully in hundreds of documentation projects.

..  epigraph::

    While redesigning the `Cloudflare developer docs <https://developers.cloudflare.com>`_, Diátaxis became our north star for information architecture. When we weren't sure where a new piece of content should fit in, we'd consult the framework. Our documentation is now clearer than it's ever been, both for readers and contributors.
