`Email Daniele Procida <daniele@vurt.org>`_. I read everything I receive. I appreciate all the
interest and do my best to reply, but I get a considerable quantity of email related to Diátaxis
and I can't promise to respond to every message.

If you'd like to discuss Diátaxis with other users, please see the *#diataxis* channel on the
`Write the Docs Slack group <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_, or the `Discussions
<https://github.com/evildmp/diataxis-documentation-framework/discussions>`_ section of the `GitHub
repository <https://github.com/evildmp/diataxis-documentation-framework>`_.

You can also submit a pull request to have your documentation listed in the :ref:`Who's using
Diátaxis <adoption>` or to suggest an improvement, or `file an issue
<https://github.com/evildmp/diataxis-documentation-framework/issues>`_.
