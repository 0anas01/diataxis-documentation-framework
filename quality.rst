Quality in documentation
=========================

Diátaxis is an approach to *quality* in documentation.

Functional quality
------------------

We need documentation to meet standards of *accuracy*, *completeness*,
*consistency*, *usefulness*, *precision* and so on. We can call these
aspects of its **functional quality**. Documentation that fails to meet
any one of them is failing to perform one of its key functions.

These properties of functional quality are all independent of each other.
Documentation can be accurate without being complete. It can be complete, but
inaccurate and inconsistent. It can be accurate, complete, consistent and
also useless.

Attaining functional quality means meeting high, objectively-measurable
standards in multiple independent dimensions, consistently. It requires
discipline and attention to detail, and high levels of technical skill.

To make it harder for the creator of documentation, any failure to meet
all of these standards is readily apparent to the user.


Deep quality
------------
There are other characteristics, that we can call **deep quality**.

Functional quality is not enough, or even satisfactory on its own as an
ambition. True excellence in documentation implies characteristics of quality
that are not included in accuracy, completeness and so on.

Think of characteristics such as:

* *feeling good to use*
* *having flow*
* *fitting to human needs*
* *being beautiful*
* *anticipating the user*

Unlike the characteristics of deep quality, they cannot be checked or
measured, but they can still be clearly identified. They are characteristics
of *deep quality*.


What's the difference?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Aspects of deep quality seem to be genuinely distinct in kind from the
characteristics of functional quality.

Documentation can meet all the demands of functional quality, and still fail
to exhibit deep quality. For example, there are many examples of
documentation that is accurate and consistent, even useful, and yet
awkward and unpleasant to use.

It's also noticeable that while characteristics of functional quality such as
completeness and accuracy are **independent** of each other, those of deep
quality are hard to disentangle. *Having flow* and *anticipating the user*
are aspects of each other - they are **interdependent**. It's hard to see how
something could feel good to use without fitting to our needs.

Aspects of functional quality can be measured - literally, with numbers, in
some cases (consider completeness). That's clearly not possible with
qualities such as *having flow*. Instead, such qualities can only be enquired
into, interrogated. Instead of taking **measurements**, we must make
**judgements**.

Functional quality is **objective** - it belongs to the world. Accuracy of
documentation means the extent to which it conforms to the world it’s trying
to describe. Deep quality can’t be ascertained by holding something up to the
world. It’s **subjective**, which means that we can assess it only in the light
of the needs of the subject of experience, the human.

And, deep quality is **conditional** upon functional quality. Documentation can be
accurate and complete and consistent without being truly excellent - but it
will never be excellent without being accurate and complete and consistent.

Finally, all of the characteristics of functional quality appear to us, as
documentation creators, as burdens and **constraints**. Each one of them
represents a test or challenge we might fail. Or, even if we have met
one *now*, we can never rest, because the next release or update means that
we'll have to check our work once again, against the thing that it's
documenting. Characteristics such as anticipating needs or flow, on the other
hand, represent **liberation**, the work of creativity or taste. To attain
functional quality in our work, we must *conform* to constraints; to attain
deep quality we must *invent*.

Diátaxis and quality
--------------------

Diátaxis cannot address functional quality in documentation. It is concerned
only with certain aspects of deep quality.


Creating deep quality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifically, Diátaxis is concerned with meeting the needs of users by paying
attention to the correct organisation of documentation, and the arrangement
of its material and the relationships within it. It is concerned with the
form and language adopted in different parts of documentation.

For example, Diátaxis is concerned with flow. In flow - whether the context is
documentation or anything else - we experience a movement from one stage or
state to another that seems right, unforced and in sympathy with both our
concerns of the moment, and the way our minds and bodies work in general.

Most obviously, Diátaxis preserves flow by helping prevent the kind of
disruption of rhythm that occurs when a digression into explanation
interrupts a how-to guide.

Or, it helps documentation fit user needs by constructing documentation
structure around them; its categories exist as a response to needs.

But, while Diátaxis can help attain beauty in documentation, at least in its
overall form, it doesn't by itself *make documentation beautiful*.

The characteristics of deep quality are forever being renegotiated,
reinterpreted, rediscovered and reinvented - what Diátaxis *can* provide is a
set of conditions for documentation in which they can be found, and therefore
has value in the creation of deep quality.


Exposing lapses in functional quality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although Diátaxis cannot serve functional quality in the same way, it can
fulfil a different role.

It works very effectively to *expose* lapses in functional quality (it's often
remarked that one effect of applying Diátaxis to existing documentation is
that problems in it suddenly become apparent that were obscured before).

For example: the Diátaxis approach recommends that :ref:`the architecture of
reference documentation should reflect the architecture of the code it
documents <respect-structure>`. This makes gaps in the documentation much
more clearly visible.

Or, moving explanatory verbiage out of a tutorial (in accordance with Diátaxis
demands) often has the effect of highlighting a section where the reader has
been left to work something out for themselves.
